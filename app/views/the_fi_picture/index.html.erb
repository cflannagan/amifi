Today is <%= DateTime.current.in_time_zone("America/New_York") %>
<br>
<br>
You are now at <%= (@fi_net_worth / @fi_spending * 100.0).round(2) %>% of the way to financial independence.
<br><br>

<b>$<%= @fi_spending.abs.round(2) %></b> is the target FI figure, based on following spending averages over the last 12 month period:
<br>

$<%= (@fi_spending.abs / 25.0).round(2) %> annually.
<br>

$<%= (@fi_spending.abs / 300.0).round(2) %> monthly.
<br><br>

<% if @fi_figure < 0 %>
  Your FI figure is short $<%= @fi_figure.abs.round(2) %>.
  <br><br>

  In order to achieve financial independence, you would need to do one of following:
  <br>

  <ul>
    <li>Add $<%= (@fi_figure.abs / 300.0).round(2) %> monthly ($<%= (@fi_figure.abs / 25.0 / 52.0).round(2) %> weekly)
    in form of passive income.</li>
    <li>Or downsize house with net gain of $<%= @fi_figure.abs.round(2) %>
    (caveats apply: 6% fee, capital gain tax, need to buy downsized home to live in, etc)</li>

    <li>
  </ul>
  <br>

<% else %>
  YOU HAVE ACHIEVED FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE! WOO WOO!
