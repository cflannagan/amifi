  #     of the way to FI life.

  #     Your FI figure is currently short $#{fi_figure.abs.round(2)}. You would need to come up with
  #     $#{(fi_figure.abs / 300.0).round(2)} additional monthly income that could be reasonably classified as passive
  #     income. Other option is to downsize house to access equity. Of course, there is also a more flexible hybrid
  #     approach: doing the combination of both downsizing to access equity and creating a new passive income stream.
